#The time series
ts3 = ts(d, start = c(1990,1), frequency = 12)
```
# Analysis
```{r}
plot(ts3, main="The Time Series Plot", xlab="Year",ylab="Data value")

```
The plot indicates that there is a clear trend and seasonality in the data set. So we need to remove those to further fit  a ARIMA model.

```{r}
Acf(ts3)
Pacf(ts3)
```

The ACF and PACF plot shows that there is also a rend and seasonality

## Differencing for trend 
```{r}
# 1st difference
d_1<- diff(ts3, 1)
adf.test(d_1)
```
SO, the first order difference make the time series stationary,

Lets check the Acf plot
```{r}
Acf(d_1)
```
The acf plot indicats that the series becomes stationary in trend.

**Lets zoom plot of the series ** 
```{r}
plot(ts3, main="The Time Series Plot", xlab="Year",ylab="Data value", xlim=c(1990,1993), lwd=2)
abline(v=c(1990,1991,1992,1993), lty=2)
```
From the above plot we can see there is a monthly seasonality, in the data, so the priod is of `s=12`.
```{r}
d_12<- diff(ts3, 12)
adf.test(d_12)

```
The p value the less than 0.05, so the first order seasonal differencing make the series deseasoanlized.

**d=1, D=1**

### To find `p` and `q`
```{r}
d_1.12<- diff(diff(ts3,12),1)
plot(d_1.12, main="Deseasonalize, and detrended Time series Plot")
Acf(d_1.12, main="The ACF Plot after differencing")
Pacf(d_1.12, main="The PACF Plot after differencing")
```

From the Acf and Pacf plot it is clear that, for the trend `p=1 or 3` and `q=1 or 3` and for the seasonal part  `P=1 to 4 ` and `Q=1`

Note that `D=1` and `d=1`



### Lets fit the ARIMA model
We will fit **alternative Arima** Model and choose that one which gives  least AIC


```{r}
library(sarima)

auto.arima(ts3, approximation = FALSE, stepwise = FALSE)
```
```{r}
#library(bayesforecast)
#auto.sarima(ts3, chains = 4)
```


```{r}
# Generating orders

p<- c(0,1,2,3)
q= c(0,1,2,3)
P<- c(0,1,2,3)
Q<- c(1)

#---------------------------- Alternative models ----------------------

for (i in 1:(length(p))) {
  for (j in 1:(length(q))) {
    for (a in 1:(length(P))) {
      for (b in 1:(length(Q))) {
        model<- Arima(ts3, order = c(P[i],1,q[j]), seasonal = list(order=c(P[a],1,Q[b]), period=12) )
        print(paste("For the model: Arima:",p[i],"1",q[j],P[a],"1",Q[1],"AIC:",model$aic))
      }
      
    }
    
  }
  
}
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


From the list of above models, we find that, the model `SARIMA( 3 ,1 ,1 ,0 ,1 ,1)` has least AIC.

```{r}
#---------------------SARIMA( 3 ,1 ,1 ,0 ,1 ,1)-------------------
s_model<- Arima(ts3,order = c(3,1,1), seasonal = list(order=c(0,1,1), period=12))
summary(s_model)

```
```{r}
#------------- Test for randomness of residuals-----------

Box.test(resid(s_model), lag = (length(ts3)-1) , type = "Ljung-Box" )
```
The p value of the test indicates that we have to accept the fact that the residuals of the models and random so, can't be further modeled.\\
**So we stick to  this model for our analysis purpose**

```{r}
plot(ts3, main="The Time Series Plot", xlab="Year",ylab="Data value", lwd=2)
lines(fitted(s_model), col="red")

```

## Forecast

```{r}
plot(forecast(s_model), main=" Forecasted for the series based on \n SARIMA (3,1,1,0,1,1)\n")
```
